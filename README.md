# Universal-PCB
board for rapid prototyping with few common used footprints under the 2.54mm grid. universal PTH pads with rectangular pads for SMD placement and holes for headers or THT with 2.54mm grid

  V1.0 basic design
  dimmensions: aprox. 91,4mm x 66mm
  Pads: Pitch 2,54mm; rounded rectangular PTH pads
  mounting 4 x M3 holes
  
  Footprints:
  2x TSSOP-16-1EP_4.4x5mm_P0.65mm
  2x SO-8_3.9x4.9mm_P1.27mm
  2x SOT-23-6
  
  manufactured at JLCPCB - finnish has to be ENIG do to large amount of PTHs.
