# Universal-PCB
board for rapid prototyping with few common used footprints under the 2.54mm grid. universal PTH pads with rectangular pads for SMD placement and holes for headers or THT with 2.54mm grid

Manufacturing verified for V1.0 at JLPCB require ENIG instead of HASL - with HASL it can leads to shortcuts (do to lot of PTH)

V1.0 basic design
